/*----------------------------------------------------------------------
  thread_pool_t is the internal threadpool structure that is cast to type 
  "threadpool" before it given out to callers.
  All accesses to a thread_pool_t (both read and write) must be protected 
  by that pool's mutex.  
  Worker threads wait on a "job_posted" signal; when one is received the 
  receiving thread (which has the mutex):
 * checks the pool state. If it is ALL_EXIT the thread decrements 
 the pool's 'live' count, yields the mutex and exits; otherwise 
continues:
 * while the job queue is not empty:
 * copy the job and arg fields into the thread, 
 * NULL out the pool's job and arg fields
 * signal "job_taken" 
 * yield the mutex and run the job on the arg.
 * grab the mutex
 * when a null job field is found, wait on "job_posted"
 The dispatcher thread dispatches a job as follows:
 * grab the pool's mutex
 * while the job field is not NULL: 
 * signal "job_posted"
 * wait on "job_taken"
 * copy job and args to pool, signal "job_posted", yield the mutex
